                        I am a Full-Stack Developer who loves learning and challenging myself daily. I have most recently been developing my skills in the MERN stack. I have received my Full Stack Wev Development Certificate from the University of Arizona's bootcamp program. Before that I finished a Bachelor's degree in Computer Information Systems with a concentration in software development as well. Programming has been a passion of mine for the last few years, and I am excited to keep learning more. When I'm not studying web development I am usually out somewhere being active. Whether it involves sports, hiking, or just going on walks around the beach I love getting up and moving!
